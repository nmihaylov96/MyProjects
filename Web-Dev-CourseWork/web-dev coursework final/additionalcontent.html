<h1>The Refugee Crisis</h1>

<div class="text">
<p>Since Russia launched a full-scale military invasion into Ukraine on February 24, 2022, fighting has caused
    over nine hundred civilian deaths and pushed millions of Ukrainians to flee to neighboring countries—the 
    majority of whom have arrived in Poland, a NATO country where U.S. troops are preparing to offer assistance
    to refugees.</p>

<p>In October 2021, Russia began moving troops and military equipment near its border with Ukraine, reigniting
    concerns over a potential invasion. Commercial satellite imagery, social media posts, and publicly released
    intelligence from November and December 2021 showed armor, missiles, and other heavy weaponry moving toward
    Ukraine with no official explanation. By December, more than one hundred thousand Russian troops were in place
    near the Russia-Ukraine border and U.S. intelligence officials warned that Russia may be planning an invasion
    for early 2022. In mid-December 2021, Russia’s foreign ministry issued a set of demands calling for the United
    States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to cease any military activity in Eastern Europe and
    Central Asia, to commit against further NATO expansion toward Russia, and to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO
    in the future.  The United States and other NATO allies rejected these demands and warned Russia they would 
    impose severe economic sanctions if Russia invaded Ukraine. The United States sent additional military assistance
    to Ukraine, including ammunition, small arms, and other defensive weaponry.</p>

<p>The United Nations, G7, EU, and other countries continue to condemn Russian actions and support Ukrainian forces.
    In an emergency United Nations session, 141 of 193 member states voted to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and
    demanded that Russia immediately cease its use of force in Ukraine. The United States has issued escalating sanctions
    on the financial assets of Putin and Sergey Lavrov’s, Russia’s foreign minister, removing Russian banks from the global
    SWIFT financial messaging system, and banning U.S. imports of Russian oil and natural gas. The U.S. continues to commit
    military assistance to Ukraine; following Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s address to Congress on March 16, 
    Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance. NATO defense ministers are drafting plans to reinforce
    troops on the alliance’s eastern flank, bringing the total number of NATO troops and national armies to 180,000.</p>

<p>Direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine continue with Zelenskyy indicating there are signs of progress; however,
    no formal agreement has been reached. Fighting on the ground has continued in and around major Ukrainian cities, with
    attacks on hospitals and residential complexes. Several Russian long-range missile strikes have caused significant damage
    to Ukrainian military assets, urban residential areas, and communication and transportation infrastructure. Civilians in
    Mariupol–a port city in southeastern Ukraine–have been facing an ongoing humanitarian crisis with acute shortages of food,
    water, and heat. Russian forces have surrounded the city for weeks with aerial bombardments that have killed hundreds of
    civilians.</p>

<p>Ukraine has been the target of thousands of cyberattacks. In December 2015, more than 225,000 people lost power across 
    Ukraine in an attack on power generation firms, and in December 2016 parts of Kyiv experienced another power blackout
    following a similar attack targeting a Ukrainian utility company. In June 2017, government and business computer systems
    in Ukraine were hit by the NotPetya cyberattack, which was attributed to Russia; the attack spread to computer systems
    worldwide and caused billions of dollars in damages. In February 2022, Ukrainian government websites, including the defense
    and interior ministries, banking sites, and other affiliated organizations were targeted by distributed-denial-of-service
    attacks alongside the Russian invasion.</p>
